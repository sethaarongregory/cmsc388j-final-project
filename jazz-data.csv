His signature look, which included an eye-patch, was due to an automobile accident that occurred during the 1960s. These things, as well as his performance style, led to Hurricane being known for his ability to improvise and adapt.

Precociously at age of 17, Chediak already began working professionally as a guitar instructor and also scoring soundtracks for films directed by Jece Valadão and others, also writing string and horn arrangements for recording sessions. Still young, he recorded a single with the actress and Belgian model living in Brazil , introducer of the little tube dress fashion in the 1960s. His students included the likes of Gal Costa, Nara Leão, Cazuza, Tim Maia, Carlos Lyra, and Elba Ramalho, among numerous others. In 1984, Almir Chediak launched his first book ""The Dictionary of Notated Chords"" and in 1986 he founded his own publishing house, the ""Lumiar Record"". At the same year, he launched his second book ""Methods of Harmony and Improvisation"". Both of his works are widely used in Brazil and have been influential in training the generation of young Brazilian musicians now entering their prime. In 1988 Almir Chediak introduced the Songbook series of Brazilian Popular Music elaborating the precise transcription of the complete lyrics, melodies and harmonies of leading composers for publication in songbooks establishing a written library to guarantee Brazilian music would survive for future generations to study and enjoy. The idea was born when Chediak was giving guitar lessons to the son of Caetano Veloso in the mid-1980s and found that Veloso was often at a loss to remember what chords he had played or the words he had sung on a particular song. It included the definitive versions of nearly 200 of Veloso's songs. In 1991, Almir Chediak launched his publishing house of CDs ""Lumiar Discos"" and the Songbooks were now accompanied by CD's that had new and innovative versions of the songs performed by other leading names of Brazilian popular music. He produced those albums, and was widely praised for rescuing obscure songs and for persuading artists to record songs that were thought to be at odds with their usual styles or public images. Now everyone in Brazil and outside the country would be able to sing and play the songs, with their proper harmonies whenever they want, and that was never before done until Chediak starts his enterprises. In all, Chediak edited 18 songbooks, featuring artists like Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque, Djavan, Noel Rosa and Ary Barroso. While nearing completion on a songbook retrospective of João Bosco and writing a biography of singer Tim Maia, Chediak was attacked by robbers and was shot to death.

Prior to his association with Stevens, Davies co-wrote, sang, and performed on two albums: in 1963, with Jon Mark, (known then as John Michael Burchell) and in 1968, as a member of the band Sweet Thursday with Mark, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Harvey Burns and Brian Odgers, when folk-rock music was still in its infancy. When their label declared bankruptcy, Davies was invited to join Cat Stevens as a session musician, who was attempting to change his sound and advance in the music world. Davies' experience, similar tastes in the emerging folk-rock genre, and capabilities with guitar and voice placed him in a pivotal role in Stevens' career, resulting in hit songs and a string of RIAA platinum certified breakthrough albums. Two such albums, Tea for the Tillerman and Teaser and the Firecat, propelled Stevens to stardom and a stellar musical career, and solidified a friendship between the two men. Davies, who recorded a solo album after a few years of backing Stevens found comparatively little commercial success on his own, particularly after several years of sitting in Stevens' charismatic shadow. He continued to tour with him and recorded on all but one of his albums, until Stevens' conversion to Islam and retirement from the pop scene in 1977. Since that time, many ""box sets"", compilations, and ""best hits"" albums have been assembled for sale with Davies' guitar work and vocals on each album. In late 2005, when Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam) returned again to write and perform, he did so with the amicable support of his friend and long-time right-hand man Davies, although nearly three decades had passed, and the two men had followed extremely different paths during the interim. Davies continues to perform with Yusuf to the present day, in addition to pursuing other musical projects. Though he played on Yusuf's first comeback record (An Other Cup, 2005), he did not appear on Yusuf's record Roadsinger (2009).",http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom,51.5,-0.116667,1942.0

Although named the Clouds of Joy, the band has also been known as the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band. They set up in the Pla-Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd and Main in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year. Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment, but she impressed Brunswick's Dave Kapp, so she became a member of the band. Kirk moved the band to Kansas City, and since their first recordings in 1929–1930, they grew popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound. In mid-1936, he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946. He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that 6-year recording layoff, as his 1929–1930 Brunswick appeared to have sold well enough to stay in the catalog through the period and 1933-34 pressings (with the mid-1930s label variations) have been seen. In 1938, Kirk and band held the top spot of the Billboard chart for 12 weeks with ""I Won't Tell a Soul (I Love You)"", written by Hughie Charles and Ross Parker, featuring Pha Terrell on vocals. In 1942, Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded ""Take It and Git"", which on October 24, 1942, became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade, the predecessor to the Billboard R&B chart.

His album ""Ode to Ireland"" won the award for the best album of the year. His roots are classical music and jazz, but he began to explore many other ethnic traditions. He was also an anticipator of minimalism and many other styles:“The categories of “World” and “New Age” music did not exist when Breschi began his trailblazing journey”.He is also a jazz innovator introducing piano in a creative way, mixing Irish and Flamenco music together with blues. Later he did the same with the Italian Pizzica and Taranta traditional music. He also developed a new trumpet sound mixing Irish sean-nós and blues, as Harry Long describes in his music anthology: “Breschi’s unique approach [...] the playing is superb and his style successfully combines Irish traditional and blues styles”.He has been breaking barriers among many different kinds of music, “yet he was the first to combine Flamenco, Basque, Arabic, Latin and Irish elements, his virtuoso jazz-styled piano uniting these traditions in remarkably original compositions.” With his work ""Orekan: The Ethnic Symphony"" he created a new “symphonic” concept bringing together piano (the top classical instrument which started the new “well tempered” system) with a vast variety of ""not tempered” instruments, belonging to many different ethnic traditions. For many years and predating the times he was gathering together extraordinary musicians from all over the world, and recording more than 25 albums which form ""The Nomadic Piano Collection"".About his ability to anticipate the times, Oliver Sweeney in the Hot Press said about his work Orekan: “Orekan is not only a masterpiece gathered together by the peculiar genius of Antóni O’Breskey; it is above all a unique social document which gives us a strong idea of our roots, and in addition points out a few possible roads we might take in the future”.He is also known to be the inspirer of the show Riverdance:“Bill Whelan developed Breschi’s synthesis of Flamenco, jazz and Irish traditional strands as a key structure in his Irish music and dance spectacular, Riverdance.”;“Well pre-dating Riverdance.”;“Ahead of his time… in 1979 Antóni O’ released a track called “Sunrise”, some of which sounds almost exactly like Riverdance” (Victoria Clarke, Sunday Independent). The track “Sunrise” was composed with the contribution of his great friend and musician Velemir Dugina. For this and many other reasons in various concerts his contribution to Irish music and culture was celebrated in the National Concert Hall in Dublin.In 2008 the Swiss National Radio Television presented his book ""Heyoka: The Soul Shaster"" with a big evening and concert, and through the notes and the reading, recalled and celebrated all his career as composer, performer, music educator, and his social work through music with Italian and Spanish emigrants, contributing hugely to the dialogue among all people and cultures.He has written 4 books: “Ecologia: Salviamo Anche la Musica”, “Semiminime”, “When Bach Was an Irish Man and Mozart a Gipsy Boy” and “Heyoka: Il Giullare dell'Anima”.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,43.7833,11.25,1950.0

By the late 1960s, Benjamin struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, and fellow Funk Brothers Uriel Jones and Richard ""Pistol"" Allen increasingly recorded more of the drum tracks for the studio's releases. Benjamin died on April 20, 1969, of a stroke at age 43. Benjamin was inducted into the ""Sidemen"" category of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. He was named the eleventh best drummer of all time by the Rolling Stone magazine in 2016.","Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.",33.5186,-86.8103,1925.0

He was born in London. His mother was of Polish stock and his father was a professional musician who had settled in Britain from Austria-Hungary in the late 1880s. His three elder brothers were also musicians. He took up the violin at an early age and won a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music. Firman’s first job, at the age of thirteen, was at the Playhouse Theatre, London, where he was part of a quintet playing entr'acte music. A year later his father negotiated a position for him in the orchestra at the Victoria Hotel in Northumberland Avenue. After only three months in this job he secured the part of Sascha, a gypsy violinist in the musical Sally at the Winter Garden Theatre, Drury Lane. The production opened on 10 September 1921, running for 383 performances. During this run, at the suggestion of the producer, George Grossmith Jr, Feuerman changed his name to Bert Firman, apparently so as to make it easier to bill in lights outside the theatre. When the run of Sally finished, Firman got a job as a violinist with the Midnight Follies Orchestra at the Metropole Hotel. Shortly after beginning this job, the current bandleader was indisposed, and Firman was offered the job. He was then only sixteen, and he would thereafter claim to have been the youngest bandleader in the world. In 1924, Firman became musical director for Zonophone Records (a subsidiary of His Master’s Voice) and in the following five years recorded over 750 sides for them. Throughout the 1920s Firman continued to lead his band from success to success, including a season in variety at the Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square and the Coliseum Theatre, whilst still also directing the Midnight Follies and then later, bands at the Devonshire Restaurant and the Carlton Hotel. As well as recording with his band, Firman also produced many recordings with a smaller group called The Rhythmic Eight. The group included such prominent musicians as Sylvester Ahola, Chelsea Quealey, Frank Guarente, Arthur Lally, Danny Polo, Max Goldberg and Jack Jackson. In 1929 Firman was given a six-month contract to be a guest conductor at N.B.C., becoming the first British bandleader to broadcast in America. He then spent some time in Hollywood adding music to a large number of silent films. Firman then formed a band in London, which he took to Les Ambassadeurs restaurant in Paris. The band included Sam Costa, a young pianist who would later become a singer and actor, as well as Freddy Gardner, a talented British saxophonist. He spent several years in France before returning to London in 1937 to form another band. During this period he broadcast regularly for the B.B.C., and had several series on Radio Luxembourg. At the outbreak of war Firman moved to the Cafe de Paris with a band that included Ivor Mairants and George Melachrino. However, after a dispute with the management he walked out. He then joined up with the South Staffordshire Regiment. After completing his training he went to Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Persia, with Stars in Battledress, an organization dedicated to entertaining the troops. Later the party moved to Europe and crossed the Rhine with the British troops. After the war Firman was set to lead a band in London again, but was annoyed at being asked to audition for the B.B.C. He therefore went to lead a band in Paris again, where he formed a band at the Bagatelle Club. The band, which included Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt, was to be his last. Firman finally retired from band leading, partly because the age of the big bands was coming to an end. He withdrew entirely from the music business, working on the London Metal Exchange until he opted for full retirement in 1976.

The credo of one record label run by Laswell which typifies much of his work is ""Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted"". Although his bands may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically. Material began as a noisy dance music band, but later albums concentrated on hip hop, jazz, or spoken word readings by William S. Burroughs. Most versions of the band Praxis have included guitarist Buckethead, but they have explored different permutations on albums.","Salem, Illinois, U.S.",38.6333,-88.95,1955.0

Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills. After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by the producer John Hammond, who commended her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson yielded the hit ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall, but her reputation deteriorated because of her drug and alcohol problems. She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Due to personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, Lady in Satin, was released in 1958. Holiday died of cirrhosis on July 17, 1959. Billie Holiday has influenced singers Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, 2pac, Diana Ross, Alicia Keys and many more. She won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1973.

Moreover, his use of extended chords and an ability to improvise freely along harmonic as well as melodic lines are echoed in post-WWII developments in jazz. ""In a Mist"" (1927) is the best known of Beiderbecke's published piano compositions, and the only one that he recorded. His piano style reflects both jazz and classical (mainly impressionist) influences. All five of his piano compositions were published by Robbins Music during his lifetime. A native of Davenport, Iowa, Beiderbecke taught himself to play the cornet largely by ear, leading him to adopt a non-standard fingering technique that informed his unique style. He first recorded with Midwestern jazz ensemble The Wolverines in 1924, after which he played briefly for the Detroit-based Jean Goldkette Orchestra before joining Frankie ""Tram"" Trumbauer for an extended engagement at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, also under the auspices of Goldkette's organisation. Beiderbecke and Trumbauer joined Goldkette's main band at the Graystone Ballroom in Detroit in 1926. The band toured widely and famously played a set opposite Fletcher Henderson at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City in October 1926. He made his greatest recordings in 1927. The Goldkette band folded in September 1927 and, after briefly joining bass saxophone player Adrian Rollini's band in New York, Trumbauer and Beiderbecke joined America's most popular dance band: Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra. Beiderbecke's most influential recordings date from his time with Goldkette and Whiteman, although he also recorded under his own name and that of Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period marked a precipitous decline in his health due to his increasing use of alcohol. Treatment for alcoholism in rehabilitation centers, with the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family, failed to stop his decline. He left the Whiteman band in 1929 and in the summer of 1931 he died in his Sunnyside, Queens, New York apartment at the age of 28. His death, in turn, gave rise to one of the original legends of jazz. In magazine articles, musicians' memoirs, novels, and Hollywood films, Beiderbecke has been envisaged as a Romantic hero, the ""Young Man with a Horn"" (a novel, later made into a movie starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Doris Day, and Hoagy Carmichael). His life has often been portrayed as that of a jazz musician who had to compromise his art for the sake of commercialism. Beiderbecke remains the subject of scholarly controversy regarding his full name, the cause of his death and the importance of his contributions to jazz. He composed or played on recordings that are jazz classics and standards such as ""Davenport Blues"", ""In a Mist"", ""Copenhagen"", ""Riverboat Shuffle"", ""Singin' the Blues"", and ""Georgia on My Mind"".","Davenport, Iowa, U.S.",41.5431,-90.5908,1903.0

C."" Ginyard, was an American gospel and doo-wop singer and songwriter who performed with various vocal groups between the 1930s and 1970s, including the Royal Harmony Singers, the Jubalaires and the Du Droppers. There is some uncertainty over his birth date and name. The Encyclopedia of South Carolina Jazz and Blues Musicians suggests, on the basis of U.S. Census information, that he was born in 1908 in Calhoun County, South Carolina, though he always claimed a birth date in January 1910. He was probably born Caleb Nathaniel Ginyard, but was also noted as Junior Caleb (J.C.) Ginyard (his father being Caleb Ginyard Sr.) or as Julius Caleb Ginyard. He got the name Ginyard from his father, who was a slave in South Carolina where he got this name from his slave boss. He sang in his a church as a youth before becoming a professional singer as a tenor (later baritone). He started his singing career as one of the founders of the Royal Harmony Singers in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1936. They moved to Philadelphia in 1941. The group worked on the Arthur Godfrey radio show in New York and later renamed their group as the Jubalaires, appearing in several movies and shorts. In 1947 Ginyard left the Jubalaires to form a new group, the Dixieaires, who remained together with a varying membership until the mid-1950s. In 1952 Ginyard also formed secular vocal group the Du Droppers,. The group recorded ""Can't Do Sixty No More"", and had two hit records in 1953, ""I Wanna Know"" and ""I Found Out (What You Do When You Go 'Round There)"". All were either written or co-written by Ginyard. He left both the Du Droppers and Dixieaires in 1955, and joined the Golden Gate Quartet. After work entertaining US troops, the group settled in Europe in 1959. In 1971, Ginyard left the group and settled in Basel, Switzerland, where he died in 1978 at the age of 68. He was married to Janie Elnora, née Flowers in USA having five children and also to Gunilla in Sweden having two children.","St. Matthews, South Carolina, United States",33.6647,-80.7789,1910.0

It is likely that Straight wrote the bulk of the composition in 1918, and Bargy added many of his individual touches to it in the performance, the end result being that there is some of each of them within.

Beginning in the early 1970s, Brent Fischer embarked on a parallel (and far more lucrative) career, eventually becoming a much sought-after arranger, providing orchestral ""sweeteners"" for pop and R&B artists such as Rufus (with Chaka Khan), Prince (a regular client from 1984 onwards, and by far Fischer's most frequent in pop music), Robert Palmer, Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion, Elvis Costello & The Roots, D'Angelo song Really Love from the album Black Messiah Grammy-winner (2016) for best R&B album, Sheila E, and many others.","Durand, Michigan, U.S.",42.9139,-83.9853,1928.0

According to Pete Frame's Rock Family Trees, Payne grew up in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex and started playing the clarinet because of his enjoyment of Dixieland jazz. On hearing swing, bebop and Dexter Gordon in the 1960s he moved to London, and began taking lessons and going to jazz clubs. He also took up the soprano saxophone, and began playing in mixed media events. He was drawn into The People Band, and moved with them to the Netherlands. He met Ian Dury when he visited London in late 1970 - ""He thought I was a junkie, I thought he was an idiot"" - and returned to the Netherlands. After the People Band played a gig in London with Kilburn and the High Roads in 1971, he was coerced into joining them for a jam at their home, and ended up staying with the band until it broke up in June 1975. He thereafter returned to Clacton; he played two gigs with Ronnie Lane, and a few with The Fabulous Poodles. In the meantime Ian Dury launched a solo career, and Payne contributed to a few songs on Dury's first album, New Boots and Panties!!, in 1977. Payne, however, joined Wreckless Eric's band. After the completion of his album and its success, Dury badgered Payne into rejoining his band, now called The Blockheads, full-time; Payne did, and became co-composer of numerous songs in their catalogue. He left the band in August 1998 but returned for an exclusive performance of New Boots And Panties!! on 17 April 2008, and on 30 April 2009 for two shows at The Electric Ballroom in Camden.","Willesden, London, England",51.5072,-0.1275,1944.0

Gordon's height was 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm), so he was also known as ""Long Tall Dexter"" and ""Sophisticated Giant"". His studio and performance career spanned over 40 years. Gordon's sound was commonly characterized as being ""large"" and spacious and he had a tendency to play behind the beat. He was known for humorously inserting musical quotes into his solos, with sources as diverse as popular tunes like ""Happy Birthday"" to the operas of Wagner. This is not unusual in common-practice jazz improvisation, but Gordon did it frequently enough to make it a hallmark of his style. One of his major influences was Lester Young. Gordon, in turn, was an early influence on John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Rollins and Coltrane then influenced Gordon's playing as he explored hard bop and modal playing during the 1960s. Gordon was known for his genial and humorous stage presence. He was an advocate of playing to communicate with the audience. One of his idiosyncratic rituals was to recite lyrics from each ballad before playing it. A photograph by Herman Leonard of Gordon taking a smoke break at the Royal Roost in 1948 is one of the iconic images in jazz photography. Cigarettes were a recurring theme on covers of Gordon's albums. Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in the Bertrand Tavernier film Round Midnight (Warner Bros, 1986), and he won a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist, for the soundtrack album The Other Side of Round Midnight (Blue Note Records, 1986). He also had a cameo role in the 1990 film Awakenings.

He taught and influenced many other musicians, including trumpeters Miles Davis, Jon Faddis, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Arturo Sandoval, Lee Morgan, Chuck Mangione, and balladeer Johnny Hartman. Scott Yanow wrote, ""Dizzy Gillespie's contributions to jazz were huge. One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time, Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up being similar to those of Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead, and it was not until Jon Faddis's emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy's style was successfully recreated [....] Gillespie is remembered, by both critics and fans alike, as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time"".","Cheraw, South Carolina, U.S.",34.6967,-79.895,1917.0

He was the first jazz talent to emerge from Europe and remains the most significant. With violinist Stéphane Grappelli, Reinhardt formed the Paris-based Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934. The group was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and briefly toured the United States with Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1946. He died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 43. Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become standards within gypsy jazz, including ""Minor Swing"", ""Daphne"", ""Belleville"", ""Djangology"", ""Swing '42"", and ""Nuages"". Jazz guitarist Frank Vignola claims that nearly every major popular-music guitarist in the world has been influenced by Reinhardt. Over the last few decades, annual Django festivals have been held throughout Europe and the U.S., and a biography has been written about his life. In February 2017, the Berlin International Film Festival held the world premiere of the French film Django.","Liberchies, Pont-à-Celles, Belgium",50.5138,4.4209,1910.0

Ashby had to overcome many obstacles during the pursuit of her career. As an African American female musician in a male dominated industry, she was at a disadvantage. In a 1983 interview with W. Royal Stokes for his book Living the Jazz Life, she remarked of her career, ""It's been maybe a triple burden in that not a lot of women are becoming known as jazz players. There is also the connection with black women. The audiences I was trying to reach were not interested in the harp, period—classical or otherwise—and they were certainly not interested in seeing a black woman playing the harp."" Ashby successfully navigated these disadvantages, and subsequently aided in the expansion of who was listening to harp music and what the harp was deemed capable of producing as an instrument. Ashby's albums were of the jazz genre, but often moved into R&B, world music, and other styles, especially her 1970 album The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby, where she demonstrates her talents on another instrument, the Japanese koto, successfully integrating it into jazz.","Detroit, Michigan, U.S.",42.3314,-83.0458,1932.0

Born in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase ""beyond category"" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music. Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges, are considered among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, and many of his pieces have become standards. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example Juan Tizol's ""Caravan"", and ""Perdido"", which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz. In the early 1940s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his writing and arranging companion. With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces. Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals. Ellington was noted for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and for his eloquence and charisma.

As a vocalist, he was a member of Les Double Six of Paris from 1961 through 1963. During this time his primary instrument became the Hammond organ. In 1964, he was awarded the Prix Django Reinhardt. For 13 years, between 1964 and 1977, he played with leading French musician Claude Nougaro. After that, he made the decision, one that his son Pierre described as ""not that easy"", to split from Nougaro to head out on a solo career. He worked with Kenny Clarke, René Thomas, and Jean-Luc Ponty. In 1971 he was a member of the Stan Getz quartet (with René Thomas and Bernard Lubat) that recorded the Getz album Dynasty (1971). Eddy Louiss had his left leg amputated in the early 1990s after suffering artery problems, following which he made few public appearances. In duet, he recorded with pianist Michel Petrucciani (1994) and accordionist Richard Galliano (2002). His later recordings, such as Sentimental Feeling and Récit proche, combined jazz with rock and world music.","Paris, France",48.8566,2.35222,1941.0

As founder and director of the cutting-edge octet 8 Bold Souls, and the 25-member performance ensemble Shadow Vignettes, Wilkerson has toured festivals and concert halls throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East. ""Defender"", a large-scale piece for Shadow Vignettes, was commissioned by the Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Fund and featured in the 10th Anniversary of New Music America, a presentation of BAM's Next Wave Festival. His music can be heard on 14 recordings, including two film soundtracks and the critically acclaimed albums Birth of a Notion, and 8 Bold Souls, both on his own Sessoms Records label. One of the great saxophone and clarinet players on the Chicago scene, Wilkerson from the 1980s into the new millennium may have become best known as a bandleader and composer, particularly associated with medium- to large-scale projects (somewhat daunting in an era when creative music bandleaders are challenged to keep even small ensembles together). He has also been a major presence in Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), teaching composition at the organization's music school and serving for a time as AACM president. The AACM collective, with its spirit of community as well as unbridled creativity, has been a predominant nurturing force for Wilkerson and has informed much of his work. He was an original member of the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble (formed by percussionist Kahil El'Zabar upon El'Zabar's 1976 graduation from the AACM school) and remained with the group until 1997, when he was replaced by Ernest ""Khabeer"" Dawkins. However, while appearing on such Ethnic Heritage Ensemble recordings as Three Gentlemen From Chicago (Moers), Hang Tuff (Open Minds), and Dance With the Ancestors (Chameleon), Wilkerson was also becoming more involved in leading his own projects, which characteristically saw the reedman thinking big. His most ambitious project, Shadow Vignettes, was initiated in 1979; with 25 musicians and incorporating dance, poetry, and visual arts, the ensemble's influences include the big band work of Muhal Richard Abrams, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Sun Ra. Shadow Vignettes released one CD, Birth of a Notion, on the Sessoms Records label in 1985. One of Shadow Vignettes' major pieces is entitled ""Defender"", commissioned by the Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Fund and featured in the tenth anniversary of New Music America, presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. Wilkerson's best-documented ensemble as a leader is 8 Bold Souls, an octet initiated in January 1985 with a series of Thursday-night concerts at the Chicago Filmmakers performance space. The popularity of the concerts led Wilkerson to establish 8 Bold Souls as a working band, and since their formation, four Souls CDs have been issued: 8 Bold Souls on Sessoms Records, Sideshow and Ant Farm on Arabesque Records, and Last Option on Thrill Jockey. Influenced by the small groups of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford, 8 Bold Souls also makes plenty of room for adventurous experimentation in the AACM spirit, drawing fully on the unusual sonic possibilities of the group's instrumentation of two woodwinds, trumpet, trombone, cello, tuba, bass, and trap drums. Overall, Wilkerson's work may be heard on 14 recordings, including two film soundtracks. In addition to his work with 8 Bold Souls, Shadow Vignettes, and the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, Wilkerson has also played with the AACM Big Band, Roscoe Mitchell, Douglas Ewart, the Temptations, Chico Freeman, Geri Allen, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Muhal Richard Abrams, Aretha Franklin, and George Lewis. Wilkerson's most recent release is the ensemble performance, Frequency, on the Thrill Jockey label. Encompassing distinctive compositions, and high-quality improvisational flights plus World and Native American sonic echoes, this debut CD confirms both the talents of the band Frequency and the continued adaptability of AACM members. Besides the AACM-link, each participant in this Chicago-based quartet brings different sensibilities to the session. It includes reedist Ed Wilkerson and bassist Harrison Bankhead from 8 Bold Souls. Flautist Nicole Mitchell leads her own groups as well as working as an educator, while veteran percussionist ’s AACM involvement goes back almost to the cooperative’s founding. Wilkerson has received grants from the Illinois Arts Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, Meet the Composer, and the Community Arts Assistance Program, and has been cited in numerous music polls. In his free time, Wilkerson, past president and longtime member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), teaches composition at the AACM School of Music.","Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S.",39.4697,-87.3897,1953.0

She was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, and after an early marriage took the surname of her husband, Fred Smith. By 1940 she was living in Los Angeles, California, with her two children, and was working as a singer in a WPA project. She sang in a vocal group, the Three Shades of Rhythm, and with the Lionel Hampton and Benny Carter orchestras, and during World War II appeared on several Armed Forces Radio Service broadcasts including sessions with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and 16-year-old pianist André Previn. She married comedian, songwriter and record producer  (1914–1992), and recorded several songs with Johnny Otis for the G&G and Gem labels, both parts of Criner's Royal Records group. She also recorded for Miltone Records in 1947, one of her songs being an answer record to label owner Roy Milton's own ""R.M. Blues"". During the 1950s, she recorded a number of tracks for Aladdin Records, including in 1953 the first version of ""Dial That Telephone"", a comedic monologue in which she complains to a friend about the absence of her husband. She also recorded with Ike Carpenter's orchestra. In 1955 and 1956, she recorded several tracks including ""Champagne Mind with a Soda Water Income"" with the Squires, a vocal group featuring Don Harris and Dewey Terry (later Don and Dewey). She recorded several versions of ""Dial That Telephone"" over the years, including a 1959 version released on Criner's Spot record label. However, the song only became a chart success in 1965, when a new recording on the Duo Disc label reached No. 36 on the Billboard R&B chart. In 1968, her recording of ""Harper Valley P.T.A. Gossip"", a spoken elaboration of the content of Jeannie C. Riley's hit ""Harper Valley PTA"", reached No. 43 on the R&B chart. Smith later worked in record promotion and A&R for Stax Records. She died from cancer in Los Angeles in 1977, aged 62. A compilation of her recordings between 1945 and 1953 was issued by the Chronological Classics label in the 1990s.

Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style, and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another. Buchanan was a patient of Miles Davis's father, who told him of his son's interest in music. Although Davis, at thirteen, was then too young to attend Buchanan's school, Buchanan began giving him private lessons. Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln. Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz, the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis' jazz style. In particular, Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato, and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding: ""Stop shakin' that note. You're going to shake enough when you get old"".  Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean, relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett (then little known beyond the East Coast) and Harold Shorty Baker. In this, too, Buchanan went against fashion; the most popular trumpeter of the day was Louis Armstrong, whose hot playing style was very different from those of Hackett or Baker. Davis later credited Buchanan with persuading his parents to buy him a new trumpet, rather than a violin as his mother had preferred. Buchanan also introduced Davis to Clark Terry, who would become his recording partner. In his autobiography, Davis recalled: ""Mr. Buchanan was the biggest influence on my life up until then. He was definitely the person who took me all the way into music at that time.""","St. Louis, Missouri, United States",40.0,-100.0,1907.0

Lewis began his career as a jazz purist, playing as a sideman for jazz artists like Wynton Marsalis, Cassandra Wilson, Elvin Jones, Jon Hendricks, and Roy Hargrove as well as performing as a member of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. However, he eventually became interested in rock music and embarked on a solo career as a crossover musician, quickly gaining recognition for his instrumental ""Rockjazz"" piano covers of mainstream rock hits like The Rolling Stones' ""Paint It, Black"" and The Killers' ""Mr. Brightside"". He released his first album of instrumental covers, entitled ELEW Rockjazz Vol. 1, on his own label, Ninjazz Entertainment, in March 2010. His distinctive style has helped him to amass a large following of celebrity fans, including Barack and Michelle Obama (for whom he has played at the White House), Leonardo DiCaprio, Donna Karan, Téa Leoni, David Duchovny, Hugh Jackman, Forest Whitaker, and Gerard Butler. Throughout his career, he has performed with musicians such as Sting, The Roots, Natalie Cole, and Esperanza Spalding. In the spring of 2011, he joined singer-songwriter Josh Groban as the opening act on the American leg of the singer's Straight to You Tour. Around the same time, he appeared as a contestant in an audition on the NBC reality series America's Got Talent, where he received a standing ovation from the crowd and positive scores from all three judges. Despite his positive reception, he ultimately dropped out of the competition in order to tour with Groban. In August 2012, he was featured on a Mike Stud remix of the Maroon 5 song ""One More Night"". On August 28, 2012, Lewis released his second solo album: ELEW Rockjazz Vol. 2. ELEW held in late 2015 a preview concert of his upcoming album And To The Republic with Jeff ""Tain"" Watts and Reginald Veal at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola. And To The Republic was released later the following year in November 2016. Since its conception the album has been praised by some of the largest jazz outlets and publications in the world such as NPR's ""Jazz Night In America"" hosted by Christian McBride, Jazz-Times, Downbeat, and All About Jazz. In summer 2016, ELEW was awarded The Novus Award at the Headquarters of the United Nations for contributing music and art to the world.","Camden, New Jersey, U.S.",39.94,-75.105,1973.0

Born in Elsa, Texas to migrant farm workers and partially blinded as an infant, Jordan was unable to work in the fields. Left at home, he found friendship and guidance among the elderly. At a very young age he was introduced to music, especially the accordion. At the time, the musician  followed the community of migrant farm workers and played for them in the labor camps. These circumstances brought the two together and the young Esteban mastered the instrument quickly. While he remained close to his traditional conjunto roots, he never limited himself musically. More than any other accordionist, Jordan pushed the diatonic accordion to its limits, both musically and physically, playing traditional conjunto, rock, jazz, salsa, zydeco and more. Jordan kept abreast of technological developments, using devices such as phase shifters, fuzzboxes, Echoplexes, for which he named a song, ""La Polka Plex"", and synthesizers, and was one of the few conjunto musicians to weave styles such as fusion jazz and rock into his music. He had also recorded country, western and mambo numbers. Members of his family frequently backed him up, including his sons Esteban Jr., Esteban III, and Ricardo.

In 1979, singer Elis Regina mentioned in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that he had been seen in jail in La Plata City; subsequent investigations by several journalists and Argentina's CONADEP confirmed his tragic fate, and he is now widely considered to be a desaparecido (missing person), therefore a victim of Argentina's State-sponsored terrorism during the 70s.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil,-15.7833,-52.0,1941.0

He has performed at clubs like Ronnie Scott´s in London and Smoke in New York. Kjekstad is known for a virtuoso way of playing the guitar, and has done many projects in the guitar/organ/drums trio concept, but also solo, duo, trio and all kind of combos. His style is influenced by different hornplayers and pianoplayers, exemplified by counterpoint chord melodies, and swinging basslines in his solo and duo work with singers and hornplayers. His own projects can be seen as “post-bop”, “hard-bop” or “neo-bop”, based in the American Blue Note tradition, but also heavy influenced by Italian and European music. He has also composed and arranged several tunes and “jazz suites” for big band. Kjekstad grew up in the Norvegian countryside just outside Oslo, in the Lier valley. He was soon captured by the music of Charlie Parker, and this led him into Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Bill Evans and guitarists Joe Pass and Pat Martino. At young age, he was also a promising operatic tenor, (studying with the internationally acclaimed Norwegian opera star Marit Isene) but chose to concentrate on the guitar as his career developed in that direction. Kjekstad´s harmonic and melodic concepts on the guitar is also inspired by the strong melodies and chords used by operatic composers like Puccini, Massenet and others.","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lier,_Norway",59.7938,10.266,1974.0

Baker gained early fame as a member of Blues Incorporated and the Graham Bond Organisation, both times alongside bassist Jack Bruce, with whom Baker would often clash. In 1966, Baker and Bruce joined guitarist Eric Clapton to form Cream, which Cream achieved worldwide success but lasted only until 1968, in part due to Baker's and Bruce's volatile relationship. After briefly working with Clapton in Blind Faith and leading Ginger Baker's Air Force, Baker spent several years in the 1970s living and recording in Africa, often with Fela Kuti, in pursuit of his long-time interest in African music. Among Baker's other collaborations are his work with Gary Moore, Masters of Reality, Public Image Ltd, Hawkwind, Atomic Rooster, Bill Laswell, jazz bassist Charlie Haden, jazz guitarist Bill Frisell and Ginger Baker's Energy. Baker's drumming is regarded for its style, showmanship, and use of two bass drums instead of the conventional one. In his early days, he performed lengthy drum solos, most notably in the Cream song ""Toad"", one of the earliest recorded examples in rock music. Baker was an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cream in 1993, of the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2008, and of the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2016. Baker was noted for his eccentric, often self-destructive lifestyle, and he struggled with heroin addiction for many years.

After leaving Blakey in 1956, Silver formed his own quintet, with what became the standard small group line-up of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums. Their public performances and frequent recordings for Blue Note Records increased Silver's popularity, even through changes of personnel. His most successful album was Song for My Father, made with two iterations of the quintet in 1963 and 1964. Several changes occurred in the early 1970s: Silver disbanded his group to spend more time with his wife and to concentrate on composing; he included lyrics in his recordings; and his interest in spiritualism developed. The last two of these were often combined, resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as The United States of Mind series. Silver left Blue Note after 28 years, founded his own record label, and scaled back his touring in the 1980s, relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income. In 1993, he returned to major record labels, releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because of health problems. As a player, Silver transitioned from bebop to hard bop by stressing melody rather than complex harmony, and combined clean and often humorous right-hand lines with darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual left-hand rumble. His compositions similarly emphasized catchy melodies, but often also contained dissonant harmonies. Many of his varied repertoire of songs, including ""Doodlin'"", ""Peace"", and ""Sister Sadie"", became jazz standards that are still widely played. His considerable legacy encompasses his influence on other pianists and composers, and the development of young jazz talents who appeared in his bands over the course of four decades.","Norwalk, Connecticut, U.S.",41.0939,-73.4197,1928.0

Soon after playing with Reinhardt, he played in a Count Basie ensemble which also included Malcolm Mitchell and Tony Crombie; he played with both of them after leaving Basie, working together with Hoagy Carmichael and Maxine Sullivan and touring in Sweden together with Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. Fallon worked in the 1950s as an accompanist to Mary Lou Williams, Sarah Vaughan, and Lena Horne, and also served as a sideman in the ensembles of Humphrey Lyttelton, Kenny Baker, and Ralph Sharon. Additionally, he was house bassist at Lansdowne Studios. He worked outside of jazz with blues musicians such as Big Bill Broonzy and Josh White, and played with Johnny Duncan's Blue Grass Boys. As the bass guitar became more popular, Fallon became a champion of its use, and played both instruments in the latter part of his career. Fallon was also involved in the industry as a booker/promoter, having established the booking agency Cana Variety in 1952. Cana booked primarily jazz artists in its early stages but expanded to rock acts in the 1960s, including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Because of this connection, Fallon was asked by the Beatles to play violin fiddle style on the song ""Don't Pass Me By"" (from The Beatles) in 1968. In 1957, Fallon married Jean Lovell and they had three children. Fallon continued to play jazz locally in London and in the studios into the 1990s. He retired from performing in 1998 due to ill health. In 2002, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London. He published a memoir entitled From the Top in 2005, and died the following year at age 90. His funeral was held on June 7, 2006 in London. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the London Music Hall of Fame.","London, Ontario, Canada",42.9836,-81.2497,1915.0

Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4. Since his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk, expansions of Grace, and the Live at Sin-é EP. Chart success also came posthumously: with his cover of Leonard Cohen's song ""Hallelujah"" he attained his first number one on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart that December. Buckley and his work remain popular and are regularly featured in ""greatest"" lists in the music press; in 2004, Rolling Stone listed him at number 39 on their list of greatest singers of all time.","Anaheim, California, U.S.",33.8361,-117.89,1966.0

The band performed on early BBC radio shows many times. They recorded on Parlophone Records. Bobby King was often the groups vocalist. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Daniels joined the Royal Air Force where he organised an air force band, and produced shows for the troops.

Joe Dodge died in 2004 in Lake Elsinore, California, at the age of 82.","Joe Dodge (February 9, 1922 – August 18, 2004) was an American jazz musician. A subtle and creative drummer, Dodge will probably always be better known for his role primarily as a timekeeper and accompanist who set a standard for blending propulsive swing, creating an adaptability that allowed him to remain in the background and not interfere with the soloist's line extended to a reluctance to take drum solos. Born in Monroe, Wisconsin, Dodge was raised and grew up in San Francisco, California. Dodge initially studied to be a symphonic percussionist, but like many young drummers of his generation, he was primarily influenced by Gene Krupa and later listened Jo Jones, Jimmy Crawford and Shelly Manne, different sources of inspiration that helped him to create his own creative style. During World War II, Dodge fulfilled his military duties from 1942 until 1945. While serving, he played drums in the Coast Artillery band, where he met tenor saxophonist Dave van Kriedt, who introduced him to Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond. After demobilization in 1946, Dodge worked in several dixieland groups and dance bands around the Bay area. In 1950, Dodge became tired of road touring and economic instability and was able to get a job working in a bank. Nonetheless, he still kept in touch with Desmond, who arranged for him to play an engagement in an octet led by Brubeck as a temporary replacement for drummer Cal Tjader. By then, the Brubeck octet was playing at the San Francisco Opera House, where they opened the show for Nat King Cole and Woody Herman. A few years later, Desmond again recommended Dodge to Brubeck. As a result, he became the regular drummer of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, participating with the group in different music venues in the United States while recording five successful albums between 1953 and 1956. During the same period, Dodge was featured in two albums with different formats directed by Desmond. Late in 1956, Dodge was worn down by the travel and intense schedule with the quartet and wanted to spend more time with his family. He then told Brubeck it was time to look for another drummer and took a day job in San Francisco. Meanwhile, in the Quartet’s New York stays, Desmond had heard the Marian McPartland trio at the Hickory House and was impressed with Joe Morello, the drummer who had been working with her since 1953. Desmond then said Brubeck that they should hire Morello, and when Brubeck heard Morello playing, he asked him if he would be interested in joining his group and the drummer did not jump at the opportunity. In 1957, Dodge had a chance to return to the jazz spotlight when bandleader Stan Kenton offered him a job as a transitory replacement for Mel Lewis, but Dodge decided to turn the offer down. From 1958 until he retired in 1981, he combined his activities working in the liquor business with musical engagements in the evenings. Dodge kept in contact with Desmond until the saxophonist's death in 1977 and never lost touch with Brubeck. At one point, Dodge played at Brubeck's fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1992 at the Claremont Hotel in Oakland, where he shared time with many of the pianist's former colleagues.

In 1933, he joined Bing Crosby as his accompanist, recording and making many radio broadcasts. He contracted tuberculosis in 1936 and while he was convalescing at a sanitarium in Monrovia in 1937, Crosby organized and appeared in a five-hour benefit for him at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles on May 23, 1937 in front of an audience of six thousand. The show was broadcast over two different radio stations with fourteen bands attending (including those led by Woody Herman, Ray Noble, Jimmy Dorsey, Jimmy Grier, Louis Prima, Harry Owens, and Victor Young) and other performers included Connie Boswell, Johnny Mercer, Red Norvo, and Ella Logan. Approximately $3,000 was raised for Sullivan. After suffering for two years with tuberculosis, he briefly rejoined Bing Crosby in 1938 and the Bob Crosby Orchestra in 1939. In 1940, when leading Joe Sullivan's Cafe Society Orchestra, he had a minor hit with ""I've Got a Crush on You"". By the 1950s, Sullivan was largely forgotten, playing solo in San Francisco. Marital difficulties and excessive drinking caused Sullivan to become increasingly unreliable and unable to keep a steady job, either as band member or soloist. The British poet (and jazz pianist) Roy Fisher celebrated Sullivan's playing with a poem, ""The Thing About Joe Sullivan"", regarded by some critics as one of the best poems about jazz. Fisher also used that title for a book of his selected poems, because (he said) he felt Sullivan was a neglected master who deserved to have his name on the cover of a book.","Chicago, Illinois, U.S.",41.8219,-87.703,1906.0

The 1990s saw Doheny doing extensive touring and studio work, both with jazz ensembles and pop groups, including Bell Biv Devoe. He released his first CD as a leader One Up, Two Back in 2002, featuring his band the John Doheny Quintet, and vocalist Colleen Savage. In 2003 he relocated to New Orleans to pursue a master's degree in jazz history at Tulane University. Doheny is noted as a colorful raconteur (no small accomplishment in a city like New Orleans). A 2002 interview with him can be found here, courtesy of smoothjazz.com, which includes an explanation of how he came to acquire the middle name ""Pip"", and an account of his early days as a struggling musician. Doheny is also a jazz historian. He holds an MA in Jazz History from Tulane University, as well as a B.mus and B.ed from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He has written articles on Jelly Roll Morton in the popular press, and published in Tulane's Jazz Archivist. He has also achieved notoriety for transcribing the music of Charles Mingus from audio form into written musical scores. Having transcribed the music of Mingus, he adapted the scores to a series of performances entitled 'Mingus Mania,' parts of which appeared on the Bravo television network in the early 1990s as musical interludes. Doheny also composed and performed source music for the soundtrack for the 1998 Bruce Sweeney film Dirty, as well as appearing with his band in the 1997 Brian Dennehy TV movie A Father's Betrayal. He is now a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana. While many New Orleans residents were displaced by Hurricane Katrina, Doheny was one of the first to return after the flood waters subsided, and was one of the most enthusiastic and vocal advocates for the rebuilding of New Orleans to its original form, history, and traditions.","Seattle, Washington, United States",47.6097,-122.333,1953.0

He then moved to the U.S., where he played with Tony Williams's group Lifetime and then with Miles Davis on his electric jazz-fusion albums In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson, and On the Corner. His 1970s electric band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Indian influences. McLaughlin's solo on ""Miles Beyond"" from his album Live at Ronnie Scott's won the 2018 Grammy Award for the Best Improvised Jazz Solo. He has been awarded multiple ""Guitarist of the Year"" and ""Best Jazz Guitarist"" awards from magazines such as DownBeat and Guitar Player based on reader polls. In 2003, he was ranked 49th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". In 2009, DownBeat included McLaughlin in its unranked list of ""75 Great Guitarists"", in the ""Modern Jazz Maestros"" category. In 2012, Guitar World magazine ranked him 63rd on its top 100 list. In 2010, Jeff Beck called McLaughlin ""the best guitarist alive,"" and Pat Metheny has also described him as the world's greatest guitarist. In 2017, McLaughlin was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.","Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England",53.5,-1.33333,1942.0

Zorn established himself within the New York City downtown music movement in the mid-1970s, performing with musicians across the sonic spectrum and developing experimental methods of composing new music. After releasing albums on several independent US and European labels, Zorn signed with Elektra Nonesuch and received wide acclaim with the release of The Big Gundown, an album reworking the compositions of Ennio Morricone. He attracted further attention worldwide with the release of Spillane in 1987 and Naked City in 1990. After spending almost a decade travelling between Japan and the US, he made New York his permanent base and established his own record label, Tzadik, in the mid-1990s. Tzadik enabled Zorn to maintain independence from the mainstream music industry and ensured the continued availability of his growing catalog of recordings, allowing him to prolifically record and release new material, issuing several new albums each year, as well as promoting the work of many other musicians. Zorn has led the hardcore bands Naked City and Painkiller, the Jewish music-inspired jazz quartet Masada, composed 613 pieces as part of the three Masada songbooks that have been performed by an array of groups, composed concert music for classical ensembles and orchestras, and produced music for opera, sound installations, film and documentary.

Rolling Stone called her ""one of the greatest songwriters ever"", and AllMusic has stated, ""When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century"". Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before busking in the streets and nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. In 1965, she moved to the United States and began touring. Some of her original songs (""Urge for Going"", ""Chelsea Morning"", ""Both Sides, Now"", ""The Circle Game"") were covered by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, Song to a Seagull, in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell, with popular songs like ""Big Yellow Taxi"" and ""Woodstock"", helped define an era and a generation. Her 1971 album Blue is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in Rolling Stone's list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". In 2000, The New York Times chose Blue as one of the 25 albums that represented ""turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music"". In 2017, NPR ranked Blue number 1 on a list of Greatest Albums Made By Women. Mitchell's fifth album, For the Roses, was released in 1972. She then switched labels and began exploring more jazz-influenced melodic ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's Court and Spark, which featured the radio hits ""Help Me"" and ""Free Man in Paris"" and became her best-selling album. Around 1975, Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz, melding it with influences of rock and roll, R&B, classical music and non-western beats. In the late 1970s, she began working closely with noted jazz musicians, among them Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned again toward pop, embraced electronic music, and engaged in political protest. In 2002, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. Mitchell is the sole producer credited on most of her albums, including all her work in the 1970s. A blunt critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th, and reportedly last, album of original songs in 2007. With roots in visual art, Mitchell has designed most of her own album covers. She describes herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance"".","Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada",54.9917,-114.377,1943.0

In the late '60s Caceres relocated to Paris, where he engaged in a wide variety of artistic pursuits, including painting, producing, teaching, and above all, playing. During this period, he became an expert on the music surrounding the Río de la Plata – styles such as tango, milonga, murga, and candombe. His musicianship flourished as he earned a reputation not only as a proficient trombonist, but as a pianist, vocalist, and songwriter as well. His debut record, entitled Sudacas, was released on the French/American label Celluloid Records. His second release, Tocá Tangó, was deeply influenced by his studies on the African origins of tango and its relationship with murga and candombe. It featured a non-traditional, fusion-oriented ensemble and the stunning candombe compositions ""Tango Negro"" and ""Tocá Tangó."" His fourth original release, Murga Argentina, found a home on the Mañana Music label.

He performed in a wide range of styles, including jazz fusion, Afro-Cuban jazz, bebop, and avant-garde. Willis was born in New York City. After his first year studying music theory at the Manhattan School of Music he began performing regularly with Jackie McLean. After he graduated he made his first jazz recording, McLean's Right Now! in January 1965, which featured two of Willis' compositions. His first recording of any type, however, was as a singer with the , performing an opera by Aaron Copland under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He decided to concentrate on jazz because of the difficulties African-American musicians had in finding work in concert music. Throughout his career he performed with a wide range of musicians, including several years as keyboardist for Blood, Sweat & Tears (beginning in 1972). He spent several years as pianist for trumpeters Nat Adderley and Woody Shaw as well as long and productive tenures with Roy Hargrove and with Jerry Gonzalez and his Fort Apache Band. His late recording with Paul Murphy, Exposé, demonstrated the fusion principles of bebop and avant-garde jazz. His composition ""Sanctuary"" began exploring works employing strings. After a successful performance in Frank Lloyd Wright's Annie Pfieffer Chapel at Florida Southern College's Child of the Sun Jazz Festival he was commissioned to write a full-scale orchestral work for jazz trio and orchestra. He worked with Hugh Masekela on a South African Suite of music and interpreted Miles Davis' work. He was in the Round About Midnight tour of Miles Davis' music.

Every night, before he goes to bed, Majeed would listen to Radio Dhahran on an old radio that works on a dry battery. Radio Dhahran used to broadcast music 24 hours a day. This boy was to become talented, addicted to symphony music that was rich in its diverse harmonies, even though he was unable to comprehend it completely at such an early age. This triggered his curiosity and posed a real challenge for him to know more and motivated him towards persistence and hard work to enter the magical world of music. After elementary school, Majeed was transferred to Bapco (Bahrain petroleum company) Training School, since being affiliated to this school ensured an income. This helped him and his family to move out from the house they rented to a better home. This income also helped him achieve his long-lasting desire to buy a musical instrument. In 1959 he bought a harmonica and along with it a book to learn how to play it. Understanding the lessons theoretically was not tough on him, but how to implement them was the problem, especially since his knowledge of English language was very limited at the time. He almost lost hope because his first attempts to learn the notes were a failure. He then decided to overcome that by learning to play by ear, he used to go out at night to the sea shore behind Gudaibiya Palace to play out what filled his mind and heart, the view of the reflection of the moon on the dancing sea waves triggered his emotions. This youth born for music was also vowed to struggle. In those beautiful times, the creative ones always found themselves biased towards the cause of their people, and the progressive route expressed that yearning for freedom. This would lead him to reading novels and literature of George Hanna, Salama Moussa, Mohammed Mandour and Maxim Gorki. The stories and novels of the latter had a deep impact on Majeed because he found in the characters of those stories live impersonations he related to in real life. In a short while, the realization came to Majeed that the Socialist ideas and directions were closest to his mind and heart. That was when he was asked if he would be interested in joining the National Liberation Front, Majeed says, ""Without hesitation, I revealed my desire and eagerness to join it!"" In 1961, he was asked by the late Baqer Kalbarham to start a music group to play at the forefront of Kalbarham's Azza* procession during the lunar month of Muharram, since he was one of the most popular musicians among the poor at the time. With great enthusiasm, Majeed took up the task. At this stage, the consciousness of the meeting point between art and music with the ideas of change got defined within him. This realization enhanced his stance that music is a means to transcend with the taste of the human being and discipline his soul. His musical skills had been improving, and other instruments started luring him into their world. In 1961, he bought the saxophone after being introduced to wind instruments like the trumpet and the clarinet. According to the late artist Ahmed Jamal, who owned a music instruments and books shop, Majeed was the first in Bahrain to buy a saxophone and a book with it to learn how to play, and he did with no help from any teacher or instructor. Majeed joined the Amateur Musicians Family in late 1963 for six months, during which he participated in various concerts and events organized by many clubs, but his membership there didn't take long for him to later become one of the founders of Al-Anwar Group. His musical and artistic knowledge continued to grow and develop and his saxophone playing skills have been improving significantly, he began to play French music which widened his artistic capabilities. He also played African, Latin American, English music (like The Beatles), Spanish and Russian; even though he was unable to continue studying music in a methodological manner. In 1967, the lyrics of the anthem ""Tareequna anta tadri shawkon wa wa'aron Aseer"" (Our path, you know, rugged, hard and filled with thorns) was discussed for the first time. Even though Majeed didn't get the full lyrics but the first verses attracted his attention so he composed the music. These lyrics would be enriched years later by the poet Ahmed Al-Shamlan, and at a later stage the artist Salman Zaiman would add a few more verses too. In 1966, Majeed would execute a heroic operation against the militants of British colonization, of which his role would remain a secret until 1969. He was then led to a mock trial which only lasted for half an hour, where the prior issued sentence was revealed. He was given a life sentence. He was then transferred to the island of Jidah. The island seemed very scary at first, because it was nothing like the other islands of Bahrain, there were mountainous plateaus, caves and everything that brings fear to a newcomer. In 1973, Majeed's attempts to convince the prison warden to get some music books in order for him to study during his free time succeeded. As soon as he had those books in his possession he began studying seriously and intensively making the best out of the isolated atmosphere he was in, taking inspiration from his musical experiments, going back to everything he had learnt with great concentration. He recomposed ""Memories"" on the note. Even though ""Memories"" wasn't his first experience in composition but it was a turning point in his career as a musician, he then composed ""Haneen"". And after reading 'The Hunchback of Notre dame' came the piece ""Esmeralda"" expressing the great influence the works of Victor Hugo had on him, especially since his romantic musical directions were going in parallel to those of the novel. He was also very influenced by the music of Hayden and Mozart; but most of all: Beethoven. Majeed found his soul as a music composer in Beethoven; he says Beethoven was just like him a deaf self-taught musician who also had revolutionary ideas; opposed the authority of the Lords and despised ingratiation. He was very interested in the works of Al-Rahbani Brothers. He performed their music and benefited from it a lot in many of his pieces including his piece ""The Island of Dreams"" which embodies the dreams, hopes aspirations and pain of many of the prisoners including himself. Specialized musicians from the Royal Swedish Academy of Music studied some of his work and ranked him at the level of high professionals. From then on, the world's recognition of Majeed as a freedom fighter and as an artist continued. In the 80's during one of the largest campaigns to demand his freedom, two of Majeed's compositions – ""Memories"" and ""Nostalgia"" – were played by the German Radio Symphony Orchestra to be heard by the progressive world and bring its attention to his talent and suffering. In 1985 at the World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow, thousands of protesting cards were signed by the representatives of the Democratic Youth Against Colonization Movement from all over the world demanding his immediate release. Majeed wrote at that moment: ""For the first time in my life, I've tasted the sweetness of the great victory!"" The passing of his mother had a great impact on Majeed, his great sorrow flooded out in the form of captivating musical pieces like ""The song of the departed"" which he composed ten days after her death, or like ""The burning of the heart"" that he composed after four days of her death and completed in one session only. It was played later by Dr. Weiry Deen, a music Professor at the University of Utah. Majeed says that his outcome of his musical compositions was based on deep self-analysis and extreme strict self-criticism leading him to complete his second symphony ""An invitation to Joy"" on his fortieth birthday on 17 August 1985. By that time, Majeed had made a firm decision that his future was in music alone, not in any other field, therefore he got himself more indulged in studying harmony, music distribution and music composition on a strict scientific basis. He was able during that time to obtain a small tape player and some cassettes on which he recorded some music works like Tchaikovsky and Beethoven which quenched some of his thirst and passion for music and helped him move on in his project. He composed some valuable pieces like The Piano Sonata and The First String Quartet; he also worked on completing his second symphony in which he avoided making the same mistakes of his first. During that period he also composed The Second String Quartet which was played later by the Adembra String Quartet Group on the International Music Day in 1999 gaining remarkable success. Majeed had turned the island of Jida into a laboratory for creative musical experiments, since the 70s he had begun teaching music to some fellow prisoners and later forming a humble music group after a few musical instruments were provided. On 8 January 1986, Majeed was transferred from Jida to the prison of Jaww. According to Majeed this transfer came with some advantages helping him with his musical project. He was placed in a private cell which he used as a music school and library with a table and a chair making it easier for him to sit and compose his music whenever he pleased. On 26 April 1990, Majeed completed his life sentence to finally breathe the air of freedom. From his first day out of prison, Majeed got affiliated to Ajras Musical Band as a composer and a musician. Among his works with Ajras was the song ""Habeebati"" (My Darling) which was performed at the 3rd Ajras concert; and also the composition, ""An invitation to affection"". Majeed continued working with immense concentration and passion on his music and also to complete writing ""The Modern Music Dictionary"" on which he was working since 1975 in prison. He then revised the first volume and included additions to the entries and footnotes, mostly on the connection between the computer and music. He devoted himself for the first volume from 1990–2002, which is released today.-- 16 March 2008.

A notable record ECM released in its early years was The Köln Concert, a solo piano performance by Keith Jarrett, which became the all-time best-selling piano album. In 1984 Eicher started a sublabel, ECM New Series, for classical music. Some of the artists whose work was released on the New Series were Steve Reich, Arvo Pärt, John Adams, Gavin Bryars, Meredith Monk, and the mediaeval composer Pérotin. Perhaps the most remarkable record was the bestseller Officium (1994), a collaboration between Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble, performing compositions by Cristóbal de Morales, Pérotin and others. In 1992 Manfred Eicher co-directed and co-wrote the film Holozän (Man in the Holocene). In 2002 he wrote the score for the film Kedma. Eicher has produced most of the records released on his label. Each jazz record takes an average of two days to record and one day to mix. Most have been recorded with Jan Erik Kongshaug (of Talent Studios and later Rainbow Studios) as sound engineer. Eicher has produced more than a thousand albums to date. Eicher's deceptively simple aesthetic is unfailingly harmonious. He records musicians he likes, allows them to trust their own instincts, and plays a directorial role. (Jazz Review)","Lindau, Germany",51.0,9.0,1943.0

Hollis wrote or co-wrote most of Talk Talk's music—including hits like ""It's My Life"" and ""Life's What You Make It""—and in later works developed an experimental, contemplative style. Beginning in 1981 as a synth-pop group with a New Romantic image, Talk Talk's sound became increasingly adventurous under Hollis's direction. For their third album, The Colour of Spring (1986), Talk Talk adopted an art pop sound that won critical and commercial favour; it remains their biggest commercial success. The band's final two albums, Spirit of Eden (1988) and Laughing Stock (1991), were radical departures from their early work, taking influence from jazz, folk, classical and experimental music. While they were commercial failures in their own time, these albums have come to be seen as early landmarks of post-rock music. After Talk Talk disbanded in 1991, Hollis returned to music in 1998 with a self-titled solo album, which continued the direction of Talk Talk's sound but in a more minimal, sparse, acoustic style. Following the release of his only solo album, Hollis largely retired from the recording industry. Hollis died, aged 64, in February 2019.","Tottenham, London, England",51.588,-0.072,1955.0

He took up the trumpet aged just 16 in 1944 and his family moved to Stanmore in Middlesex in 1946. He organised a new group called the 'Stanmore Stompers' a year later in 1947. He is probably best known for his work with his own seven piece group 'The Delta Jazzmen'. He led this group from 1948 to 1974 and again in the 1990s. He did move out to Spain briefly in the mid-1960s. Very little recorded output exists during his lifetime of playing except for two albums worth of material, one of which was entitled 'Mike on Mike' from 1960. However, there exists some well recorded performances by the Delta Jazzmen which feature Daniels from 1958 to 1963 along with additional input from trombone player Gordon Blundy and John Barnes on reed instruments. The rhythm section is accompanied on these works by banjo-tuba-drums. Daniels was regarded as an ensemble-orientated player who provided a solid lead combined with laid-back solos. The British Lake Label produced 'Limited Edition' recordings of Daniels' work. Daniels' aspired to reproduce the original styles of King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong and others as authentically as possible during live performance. Some of his other bands have featured talents such as Keith Nichols and John Chilton. He died on 18 October 2016 at the age of 88.","Norbiton, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey",51.4119,-0.28311,1928.0

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis left to study at the Juilliard School in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S. Davis made several lineup changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin. This period, beginning with Davis' 1969 studio album In a Silent Way and concluding with the 1975 concert recording Agharta, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record Bitches Brew helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed. After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as The Man with the Horn (1981) and Tutu (1986). Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which recognized him as ""one of the key figures in the history of jazz"". Rolling Stone described him as ""the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"" while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.","Alton, Illinois, US",38.9006,-90.1597,1926.0

She was a staple of television variety shows and a dominant figure in Italian pop music from the 1960s to the mid-1970s, known for her three-octave vocal range, the agility of her soprano voice, and her image as an emancipated woman. In performance, Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and swing music, which made her the most versatile pop singer in Italian music. Mina dominated the country's charts for 15 years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity. She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts. Mina's TV appearances in 1959 were the first for a female rock and roll singer in Italy. Her loud syncopated singing earned her the nickname ""Queen of Screamers"". The public also labeled her the ""Tigress of Cremona"" for her wild gestures and body shakes. When she turned to light pop tunes, Mina's chart-toppers in West Germany in 1962 and Japan in 1964 earned her the title of the best international artist in these countries. Mina's more refined sensual manner was introduced in 1960 with Gino Paoli's ballad ""This World We Love In"", which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. Mina was banned from TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois morals. After the ban, the public broadcasting service RAI tried to continue to prohibit her songs, which were forthright in dealing with subjects such as religion, smoking and sex. Mina's cool act combined sex appeal with public smoking, dyed blonde hair, and shaved eyebrows to create a ""bad girl"" image. Mina's voice has distinctive timbre and great power. Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones. The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues, R&B and soul music during the late 1960s, especially when she worked in collaboration with the singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti. Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills, particularly ""Brava"" by Bruno Canfora (1965) and the pseudo-serial ""Se telefonando"" by Ennio Morricone (1966). The latter song was covered by several performers abroad. Shirley Bassey carried Mina's ballad ""Grande grande grande"" to charts in the U.S., UK, and other English-speaking countries in 1973. Mina's easy listening duet ""Parole parole"" was turned into a worldwide hit by Dalida and Alain Delon in 1974. Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 but has continued to release popular albums and musical projects on a yearly basis to the present day.","Busto Arsizio, Italy",45.6,8.83333,1940.0

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being ""Pata Pata"" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song ""Soweto Blues"", written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film Sarafina!. She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy. Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that ""her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.""","Prospect Township, Johannesburg, Union of South Africa",-26.2044,28.0456,1932.0

His writing influence on R&B had well-known fans recording his songs, among them Pete Townshend, who recorded his ""Young Man Blues"" for the Who's Live at Leeds album in 1970. John Mayall was one of dozens who recorded his classic, ""Parchman Farm"", and Georgie Fame used many of Allison's songs. Others who recorded his songs included Leon Russell (""I'm Smashed"") and Bonnie Raitt (""Everybody's Crying' Mercy""). The 1980s saw an increase in his popularity with new fans drawn to his unique blend of modern jazz. In the 1990s he began recording more consistently. Van Morrison, Georgie Fame and Ben Sidran collaborated with him on a tribute album, Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison. The Pixies wrote the song ""Allison"" as a tribute.

Peart earned numerous awards for his musical performances, including an induction into the Modern Drummer Readers Poll Hall of Fame in 1983, making him the youngest person ever so honoured. His drumming was renowned for its technical proficiency and his live performances for their exacting nature and stamina. Peart was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and grew up in Port Dalhousie (now part of St. Catharines). During adolescence, he floated between regional bands in pursuit of a career as a full-time drummer. After a discouraging stint in England to concentrate on his music, Peart returned home, where he joined Rush, a Toronto band, in mid-1974, six years after its formation. They released nineteen studio albums, with ten exceeding a million copies sold in the United States. Billboard ranks the band third for the ""most consecutive gold or platinum albums by a rock band"".Early in his career, Peart's performance style was deeply rooted in hard rock. He drew most of his inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon, Ginger Baker, and John Bonham, players who were at the forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. In addition to serving as Rush's primary lyricist, Peart published several memoirs about his travels. His lyrics for Rush addressed universal themes and diverse subjects including science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy, as well as secular, humanitarian, and libertarian themes. Peart wrote a total of seven nonfiction books focused on his travels and personal stories. On December 7, 2015, Peart announced his retirement from music in an interview with Drumhead Magazine, though bandmate Geddy Lee insisted Peart was quoted out of context, and suggested Peart was ""simply taking a break"". However, in January 2018, bandmate Alex Lifeson confirmed that Rush was retiring due to Peart's health issues. During his last years Peart lived in Santa Monica, California with his wife, Carrie Nuttall, and daughter. After a three and a half year illness, Peart died of glioblastoma on January 7, 2020, at age 67.","Hamilton, Ontario, Canada",43.2567,-79.8692,1952.0

Her music spanned a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. The sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition, which she attributed to racial discrimination. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree. To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to ""Nina Simone"" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play ""the devil's music"" or so-called ""cocktail piano"". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with ""I Loves You, Porgy"". Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.","Tryon, North Carolina, U.S.",35.2089,-82.2389,1933.0

He was educated at Springfield High School, then attended Dartmouth College and Columbia University. At Dartmouth, he formed his own band and toured with the college band. He joined Columbia's dance band, The Blue Lions, but was temporarily unable to perform following a rail accident, and he did some arrangements while he recovered. Weston sold his first musical arrangements to Joe Haymes in 1934. After Haymes requested more material, Weston's music was heard by Rudy Vallée, who offered him work on his radio show. Weston met Tommy Dorsey through Haymes and in 1936 became a member of Dorsey's orchestra. Weston persuaded Dorsey to hire The Pied Pipers after hearing them in 1938, and the group toured with the bandleader. After leaving Dorsey in 1940, Weston worked with Dinah Shore and moved to Hollywood after being offered work in films. In California he met Johnny Mercer, who invited him to write for his new label, Capitol Records. Weston became music director at Capitol, where he worked with Jo Stafford and developed the mood music genre. Stafford moved with him to Columbia Records in 1950, and the couple were married in 1952.

He co-wrote the 1925 jazz classic ""Flamin' Mamie"". His popularity faded in the swing music era of the mid-1930s, and by the 1940s he was semi-retired from music. He experienced a revival and had a comeback in the 1950s with his own network television series, Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue, which ran for three seasons. He also hosted the 1954 ABC talent contest show On the Boardwalk with Paul Whiteman. Whiteman's place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that his ornately orchestrated music was jazz in name only, lacking the genre's improvisational and emotional depth, and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman's fondness for jazz was genuine. He worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation. His bands included many of the era's most esteemed white musicians, and his groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire. Critic Scott Yanow declares that Whiteman's orchestra ""did play very good jazz...His superior dance band used some of the most technically skilled musicians of the era in a versatile show that included everything from pop tunes and waltzes to semi-classical works and jazz.

He adopted the name La Roca early in his musical career when he played timbales for six years in Latin bands. In 1957 Max Roach became aware of him while jamming at Birdland and recommended him to Sonny Rollins. As drummer of Rollins' trio on the afternoon set at the Village Vanguard on November 3 he became part of the important record A Night at the Village Vanguard (Originally only one of five recorded tracks with La Roca found their way on the album). In 1959 he recorded with Jackie McLean (New Soil) and in a quartet with Tony Scott, Bill Evans and Jimmy Garrison. Besides Garrison he often joined with bassists who played in the Bill Evans Trio, especially Scott LaFaro and Steve Swallow, and also accompanied pianists like Steve Kuhn, Don Friedman and Paul Bley.

In 1968 he stopped taking side-man gigs, and only accepted work as a band leader. La Roca began earning a living by driving a taxi cab in New York City, and later attended law school at New York University. When his second album as leader, Turkish Women at the Bath, was released under Chick Corea's name without La Roca's consent, La Roca filed and argued a lawsuit against Douglas Records, and the erroneously-labeled records were recalled.

Napoleon began with classical training, and was performing publicly by age 5. In the 1910s, he was one of the first musicians in the northeastern United States to embrace the new ""jass"" style brought to that part of the country by musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana. With pianist Frank Signorelli he formed the group ""The Original Memphis Five"" in 1917. He became one of the most sought after trumpeters of the 1920s. The group were very prolific, one of the most prolific in New York City at the time, and in 1922-1923 alone made over a hundred recordings. Napoleon's 1927 version of ""Clarinet Marmalade"" was a particular success. The Original Memphis Five split in 1928. During the 1930s Napoleon mainly worked as a session trumpeter, working in the RCA Radio Orchestra in the early 1930s, and in 1937 unsuccessfully tried to form his own orchestra. He recorded with the  and the Charleston Chasers and also worked with blues singers Leona Williams and Alberta Hunter. Napoleon joined Jimmy Dorsey's then Los Angeles-based group in the mid 1940s, and he appeared with the band in the film Four Jills in a Jeep. Parting with Dorsey in 1947, he moved back to New York and worked as a studio musician at NBC until 1949-1950 when he reformed The Original Memphis Five. During the early 1950s the group became noted for their performances at Nick's in New York City. Phil also worked frequently with his nephew Marty Napoleon, a jazz pianist. On July 3, 1959, Napoleon and The Five performed at the Newport Jazz Festival, later released as an album. In 1966 opened up his own club named ""Napoleon's Retreat"" in Miami, Florida where he lived until his death, although continued to perform Dixieland jazz in the club up until the 1980s.","Boston, Massachusetts, US",42.3581,-71.0636,1901.0

He was a founding member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd, performing on all but one of their albums and playing on all of their tours. Wright grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex and met future Pink Floyd bandmates Roger Waters and Nick Mason while studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic. After being joined by frontman and songwriter Syd Barrett, the group found commercial success in 1967. Barrett's instability led to him being replaced by David Gilmour and Wright taking over songwriting duties with Waters. Initially a straightforward singer/songwriter, Wright later acted as an arranger to Waters and Gilmour's compositions. He began to contribute less towards the end of the 1970s and left the band after touring The Wall in 1981. He rejoined the band as a session player in 1987 for A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and became a full-time member again for The Division Bell in 1994. Sessions with Wright during this period were later released on the album The Endless River. Away from Pink Floyd, Wright recorded two solo albums, including a collaboration with Anthony Moore on Broken China, and briefly formed the duo Zee. After rejoining Waters, Mason and Gilmour as Pink Floyd for Live 8 in 2005, he became part of Gilmour's regular solo touring band, singing occasional lead on songs such as ""Arnold Layne"", before his death in September 2008. Overshadowed by bandmates, Wright's death brought a reappraisal and recognition of his talents. His jazz and improvisation influences and keyboard performances were an important part of the Pink Floyd sound. As well as being a prominent player of the Farfisa and Hammond organs and the Kurzweil synthesizer, Wright sang regularly in the band and occasionally took the lead vocal on songs such as ""Time"", ""Remember a Day"" and ""Wearing the Inside Out"".","Hatch End, Middlesex, England, UK",51.5,-0.116667,1943.0

In September 1948, the quartet went on the road as The Four Freshmen, and soon drew the admiration of jazz legends such as Dizzy Gillespie and Woody Herman. In 1950, The Four Freshmen got a break when band leader Stan Kenton heard the quartet in Dayton, Ohio, and arranged for an audition with his label, Capitol Records, which signed The Four later that year. In 1952, they released their first hit single ""It's a Blue World"". Further hits included ""Mood Indigo"" in 1954, ""Day by Day"" in 1955, and ""Graduation Day"" in 1956. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, The Four Freshmen released a number of recordings, made film and television appearances, and performed in concert. The group eventually lost their mainstream following with the advent of the British pop bands of the 1960s. After Barbour's retirement in 1977, the Freshmen continued under the management of Flanigan, who kept the rights to The Four Freshmen name. Flanigan died on May 15, 2011 at the age of 84.

However, soon after she decides to move away from the stage and dedicate herself to journalism and showbiz, maintaining her artistic activity as a composer and writer. In 2002, the increasingly intense musical partnerships make her move to Rio de Janeiro. In that decade, she bursts as composer in the voices of Zélia Duncan and Frejat, with the song Mãos Atadas. The recording was homage from Zélia to Cássia Eller, with whom she used to sing the blues on the musical scene of Brasília, in the early 80's. From then on, her compositions have been recorded by many singers, among other artists, by Fábio Jr., Leonardo, Dillo Daraujo, Ronaldo Barcelos, by the duo Zélia Duncan and Simone and by Ana Carolina, who released the hit Vai. In 2012, the unpublished song Flor do Sol – composed thirty years before in partnership with Cássia Eller and recorded on a simple cassette tape –was released as a single by Porangareté label. The track, reworked by Chico Chico (Eller's son), with his participation and Cássia's former musicians, was officially released on TV Globo's ""Fantástico"", to celebrate the day Cássia Eller would have turned 50. In 2016, Simone Saback releases another single: Mãos Atadas, in the voices and guitars of herself and Cássia Eller's. This track is also based on the recording of their rehearsal on a simple cassette tape, and carried out at Simone's house in 1982.

He also made a few brief film appearances, most notably in collaboration with director Ida Lupino. Ellis began his career as pianist playing live for a local Houston radio station (later known as KPRC) in the early 1920s. In 1925 he was added to the orchestra of  for a ""field trip"" recording session for Victor Records and was also allowed to cut two piano solos. Although unissued for technical reasons, these solo efforts led to Ellis being invited to Victor's regular recording studio in Camden, New Jersey to cut a number of piano solos, all or most of them compositions of his own. These were among the earliest records Victor made using the new electric microphone and recording equipment, a technique that was yet not perfected which probably explains why only four of the titles were eventually issued. Of these the coupling Prairie Blues and Sentimental Blues became a minor hit. After his first recording experiences Ellis returned to Houston and radio work as well as playing in vaudeville theaters. During this period Ellis, mainly on request of his employers at the radio station, began adding singing to his piano playing. His pleasant voice went well with the audiences and in 1927 he was invited to New York City to make vocal test recordings. His first issued vocal record was Sunday on the Columbia label. This was followed by a string of records for Okeh Records where Ellis was usually backed by small studio groups that he was allowed to pick himself. Ellis used the opportunity to select many of the best jazz musicians of the time including Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Andy Sannella and - on two occasions - even Louis Armstrong. On these records Ellis sang in a bittersweet alto, with which he was uncomfortable early in his career, believing his voice to be too high. Ellis was popular enough during the time he was on OKeh for them to create a special silver colored custom label for his records. Ellis's first recording career ended in 1931. In the late 1930s however, he returned with a big band of his own, known as his ""Choirs of Brass Orchestra"" with himself conducting and taking occasional vocals. The band also featured his wife, Irene Taylor as a vocalist. Later in his career, Ellis focused more on songwriting, although he continued to record sporadically as well as playing the piano. In 1939 Ellis reorganized and his new band featured the conventional four-man reed section. He disbanded in 1941 and enlisted in the Army-Air Force in 1942. After moving back to Texas he began to be less active as a performer and more involved in songwriting. Among his many compositions are ""My Beloved Is Rugged"" and ""11:60PM"" (both recorded by Harry James), ""Gene's Boogie"" (recorded by Gene Krupa), and ""Little Jack Frost, Get Lost"" and ""You're All I Want for Christmas"" (both recorded by Bing Crosby). ""December"" was recorded by Count Basie with a Mills Brothers vocal.

Born in Caracas, Monasterios has been considered as one of the major jazz artists to emerge from Venezuela. He grew up surrounded by jazz music and developed his piano playing and harmony skills by exploring music on his own. Known for his lyrical style of playing, Monasterios was particularly influenced by the work of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and McCoy Tyner. He received formal musical training at the José Angel Lamas School of Music and began his professional career at the age of 18, combining this knowledge and these influences by performing and recording with some of the most prominent Venezuelan artists of the time. In 1989, Monasterios traveled to Miami, Florida to participate in the Miami Jazz Festival, where he earned an award for Best Instrumental Soloist performance, which granted him a scholarship from Miami Dade College. He then moved to the United States in 1990 to attend college, and later received other recognition from the University of Colorado in 1991, earning Outstanding Soloist award honors. Entering 1997, Monasterios released his first album, Roads Not Taken, to expand his own sound world with a selection of eight original compositions, which featured upright bassist Marc Johnson and multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan among other invitees. After that, he received a music scholarship from the University of Miami, from which he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1995. Never stationary or stale, he next returned to the University of Miami in 2002 and obtained a master's degree in Jazz Piano and Pedagogy. In between, Monasterios still performing and recording with a significant number of jazz musicians, like Randy Brecker, Donald Byrd, Larry Coryell, Paquito D’Rivera, Allan Harris, Terumasa Hino, Freddie Hubbard, Dave Liebman, Othello Molineaux, Nathen Page, Claudio Roditi, Arturo Sandoval, Néstor Torres, Dave Valentin and Jeff 'Tain' Watts, as well as for performers including Dee Dee Bridgewater, Shakira and David Lee Roth. As a result, Down Beat magazine honors followed in 2005 with the Best Jazz Instrumental Soloist award for the 28th Annual Student Music Awards. Additionally, he also won in the category of Original Song, Outstanding Performance for his composition, Ávila. It prompted the release of his second album, Fostered, in 2006, where all eight tracks were written by himself, including the aforementioned Ávila, while leading a quintet of young musicians. In 2007, Monasterios produced the album Jazz Impressions 1, recorded live at the NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale in Florida, which is an inspired, piano-led set of straight-ahead jazz co-led by Monasterios, bassist Mark Egan and drummer Paul Wertico, whose repertoire included more original songs. Thereafter, Monasterios collaborated with percussionist Sammy Figueroa in The Magician, released in 2007 and submitted for nomination to the 50th Annual Grammy Awards as Best Latin Jazz Album, in which Monasterios provided performances, orchestrations, production, and two compositions including the title track. Subsequently, the Miami New Times newspaper named Monasterios as Best Jazz Musician in their Best of Miami issue of June 11, 2009. True to his vibrant personality and tireless pursuit, in 2011 Monasterios formed a new quintet and completed a recording of his exploration in the form of eight original tunes, entitled Unconditional. This collection shows craftsmanship and fine improvisations, with an emphasis on composition and attention to detail. Besides, Monasterios offers an assortment of Venezuelan percussion instruments and rhythms, in a firm understanding of his roots without deviating from the jazz mainstream and the urban music landscape. Currently, Monasterios continues performing in different cities of the United States, and regularly conducts clinics, master classes and workshops at colleges, universities and arts centers around the World, including the prestigious National Network of Youth and Children's Orchestras of Venezuela, also known as El Sistema.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venezuela,7.0,-66.9167,1964.0

Her guitar playing technique had a profound influence on the development of British blues in the 1960s; in particular a European tour with Muddy Waters in 1964 with a stop in Manchester on 7 May is cited by prominent British guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Keith Richards. Willing to cross the line between sacred and secular by performing her music of ""light"" in the ""darkness"" of nightclubs and concert halls with big bands behind her, Tharpe pushed spiritual music into the mainstream and helped pioneer the rise of pop-gospel, beginning in 1938 with the recording ""Rock Me"" and with her 1939 hit ""This Train"". Her unique music left a lasting mark on more conventional gospel artists such as Ira Tucker, Sr., of the Dixie Hummingbirds. While she offended some conservative churchgoers with her forays into the pop world, she never left gospel music. Tharpe's 1944 release ""Down by the Riverside"" was selected for the National Recording Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress in 2004, which noted that it ""captures her spirited guitar playing and unique vocal style, demonstrating clearly her influence on early rhythm-and-blues performers"" and cited her influence on ""many gospel, jazz, and rock artists"". (""Down by the Riverside"" was recorded by Tharpe on December 2, 1948, in New York City, and issued as Decca single 48106.) Her 1945 hit ""Strange Things Happening Every Day"", recorded in late 1944, featured Tharpe's vocals and electric guitar, with Sammy Price (piano), bass and drums. It was the first gospel record to cross over, hitting no. 2 on the Billboard ""race records"" chart, the term then used for what later became the R&B chart, in April 1945. The recording has been cited as a precursor of rock and roll. On December 13, 2017, Tharpe was chosen for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence.","Cotton Plant, Arkansas, U.S.",35.0033,-91.2514,1915.0

Robinson would work with Hayes in several different line-ups and was present on the final public appearance of Hayes' big band at Ronnie Scott's club in February 1973. During 1960-61, Robinson was a member of the third incarnation of the Jazzmakers, co-led by drummer Allan Ganley and trombonist Keith Christie which also included pianist Colin Purbrook and bassist Arthur Watts. This group recorded an as yet unissued album at IBC Studios in London in December 1960, which had it been released would have marked Robinson's debut recording.During the 1960s he played with various prominent UK jazz groups including the Phil Seamen Quintet, The Downbeat Big Band, Tubby Hayes’ Big Band, John Burch’s Octet, Long John Baldry, Sandy Brown's band (also featuring Al Fairweather, Malcolm Cecil and Brian Lemon), Humphrey Lyttelton (in both a big band and small group setting), The Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band and the BBC Radio Orchestra. Together with fellow tenors Dick Morrissey and Al Gay, baritone sax Paul Carroll, and trumpets Ian Carr, Kenny Wheeler and Greg Bowen, he formed part of (Eric Burdon and) The Animals' Big Band that made its one-and-only public appearance at the 5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival in Richmond (1965). In the early 1970s, he was a member of the Don Rendell Quintet, with drummer Trevor Tomkins and multi-instrumentalist Peter Shade, appearing on Rendell's albums Change Is (1969) and Space Walk (1972). He remained associated with Rendell intermittently until the 2000s.During 1970-1973 Robinson was a member of trumpeter Maynard Ferguson's big band, then based in the United Kingdom and comprising British musicians. Robinson can be heard on the albums MF Horn 2 and Alive and Well in London, an album on which he and Alan Skidmore share the (uncredited) saxophone solos.During the late 2000s, former Ferguson manager and sideman Ernie Garside authorised the release of two volumes of previously unissued Ferguson recordings dating from the 1970s, on which Robinson is also prominently featured, although sadly his contributions are often misattributed to other players. Widely recognised for his full-toned delivery, agile technique and harmonic detail, Robinson's style during the 1960s and 1970s reflected the influence of several leading American jazzmen, including Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson, whose work he closely echoes on the album Space Walk. He also made effective use of the flute, clarinet, alto and soprano saxes. Robinson is also regarded as an authority on saxophone mouthpieces, in particular in adapting and altering their internal dimensions to suit a particular player's style and requirements. The US stars he toured with include King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gillespie, Andy Williams and Tony Bennett. In 1987, he toured the United States with Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts’ Orchestra, taking his place in a saxophone section also including fellow tenorists Alan Skidmore, Danny Moss, Bobby Wellins, Don Weller and Evan Parker. Robinson has also led his own quartets, sometimes including long-term colleague, pianist Brian Dee. During the 2000s he continued to co-lead a trio with ex-Nucleus keyboardist , often working with veteran vocalist Frank Holder.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Salford,53.5097,-2.33444,1936.0

The gig lasted two weeks and ended when Johnson came into work and found himself replaced by Yusef Lateef, the multi-instrumentalist. Mingus explained: ""If you were me, and had the chance to hire Yusef Lateef or you, who would you hire?"" In 1971, eleven years later, Mingus climbed the stairs to Emile Charlap’s copying office, home to many great arrangers, and before he left, he gave Johnson Let My Children Hear Music to arrange, which featured two Mingus pieces, ""Shoes of the Fisherman’s Wife (Are Some Jiveass Slippers)"" and ""Don’t Be Afraid, the Clowns Afraid Too"". The album's emergence was heralded with a live concert, Mingus And Friends At Philharmonic Hall, also arranged by Johnson and released as an album. Johnson continued to work with Mingus until his death from Lou Gehrig’s disease in 1979. Mingus recorded two of Johnson’s compositions, ""Wee"" and ""For Harry Carney"", and nominated Johnson for a Guggenheim award following his own in Jazz composition.

Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than a thousand pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70. Monk's compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations. His style was not universally appreciated; the poet and jazz critic Philip Larkin dismissed him as ""the elephant on the keyboard"". Monk was renowned for a distinct look which included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano. Monk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time magazine (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis).

His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres. Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family in Pomona, California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a teenager. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented Closing Time (1973) and The Heart of Saturday Night (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with Small Change (1976), Blue Valentine (1978), and Heartattack and Vine (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film One from the Heart (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films. In 1980, Waits married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including Swordfishtrombones (1983), Rain Dogs (1985), and Franks Wild Years (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson, he produced the musicals The Black Rider and Alice, first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums Bone Machine (1992), The Black Rider (1993), and Mule Variations (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label ANTI-, which released Blood Money (2002), Alice (2002), Real Gone (2004), and Bad as Me (2011). Despite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international cult following. In 2011, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on Rolling Stone's ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". Several biographies have also been written about him.","Pomona, California, U.S",34.0608,-117.756,1949.0

It has been noted by Branford Marsalis that Braud was the first to utilize the walking bass style that has been a mainstay in modern jazz [opposed to the 'two-beat' pattern the tuba plays in the New Orleans style]. His vigorous melodic bass playing, alternately plucking, slapping, and bowing, was an important feature of the early Ellington Orchestra sound in the 1920s and 1930s. Braud's playing on Ellington's regular radio broadcasts and recordings helped popularize the slap style of string bass playing, as well as encouraging many dance bands of the time to switch from using a tuba to an upright bass. (Like many of his contemporary New Orleans bassists, Braud doubled on tuba, and he recorded on that instrument on some sides with Ellington.) In 1936 Braud co-managed a short lived Harlem club with Jimmie Noone, and recorded with the group Spirits of Rhythm from 1935 to 1937. He played with other New York bands including those of Kaiser Marshall, Hot Lips Page, and Sidney Bechet, and returned for a while to Ellington in 1944. In 1956 he joined the Kid Ory Band. In the late fifties he joined Barbara Dane's trio alongside pianist/cornetist Kenny Whitson, turning down opportunities to return to Duke Ellington's band or tour with Louis Armstrong. He is a distant relative of the Marsalis brothers on their mother's side. He died in Los Angeles, California.","St. James Parish, Louisiana, United States",30.03,-90.8,1891.0

Moore earned a modest hit on the Hot R&B charts with ""We're Gonna Rock, We're Gonna Roll"", which also was one of the earliest rock and roll records. Moore was born in Detroit Michigan and began playing the alto saxophone at an early age. However, prior to his musical career, he was an amateur boxer, winning Michigan's Golden Gloves light heavyweight championship in 1937, before briefly turning professional. By the early 1940s, Moore abandoned his boxing career in favor of music, and was inspired by musicians Chu Berry and Illinois Jacquet to switch to tenor saxophone. In 1944, he made his recording debut, accompanying Christine Chatman, the wife of Memphis Slim, for Decca Records. Between 1945 and 1947, Moore was performing and recording in Los Angeles with Slim Gaillard, Jack McVea, Big Joe Turner, Dexter Gordon, and played on Helen Humes’ hit recording, ""Be-Baba-Leba"". In 1947 he moved back to Detroit and began recording with his own band, which included baritone player Paul Williams, later famous for ""The Hucklebuck"". In December of that year, he recorded ""We're Gonna Rock, We're Gonna Roll"" for the Savoy label which was a modest hit and is remembered today as one of many candidates for the first rock and roll record. It was one of the first records played by Alan Freed on his ""Moondog"" radio shows in 1951. However, by the standards of its time it was quite a primitive recording, notable mainly for the juxtaposition of the words “rock” and “roll”, and the battling saxophones of Moore and Williams. In 1949, he cut ""Rock And Roll"", reportedly featuring Scatman Crothers on vocals. Moore continued recording and playing in clubs in and around Detroit. In this period he also recorded several jazz albums for the Jazzland label. In 1971, he was sought out by Marvin Gaye to play saxophone on the album What's Going On, notably the track ""Mercy Mercy Me"". Eventually he returned to Los Angeles, California and lived there until his death, aged 65.

Kellerman received a Grammy Award at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards for his 2014 album Winds of Samsara, a collaboration with Indian composer and producer Ricky Kej. Winds of Samsara reached No. 1 on the US New Age Album Billboard Charts and also peaked at No. 1 on the ZMR (Zone Music Reporter) Top 100 Radio Airplay Chart in the month of July 2014. Kellerman's Love Language (2015) received a Grammy® Nomination for 'Best Contemporary Instrumental Album', and won a SAMA for 'Best Instrumental and/or Classical Album'. It debuted at nr. 1 on the World Music Billboard charts in July 2015. This album also featured at No. 1 on the ZMR Top 100 International Radio Airplay Chart in August 2015, and spent 11 weeks in the CMJ New World Top 40 Chart, peaking at nr. 12. His next adventure was a collaboration with the Soweto Gospel Choir, Symphonic Soweto – A Tribute to Nelson Mandela. The album sees the two Grammy® winners re-conceptualise traditional music, freedom songs (including Mandela favourite, “Lizalis’idinga”) and popular songs by South African legends (including Brenda Fassie, Lucky Dube and Miriam Makeba), from a symphonic and choral perspective – as part of honouring Nelson Mandela in the year he would have celebrated his 100th birthday. Symphonic Soweto won the 2018 SAMA for Best Adult Contemporary Album - Kellerman's seventh SAMA recognition. From Symphonic Soweto, Kellerman’s collaborative composition Soweto Travels won the USA Songwriting Competition for Best Instrumental Composition in 2017. As part of his mission to work with and uplift children, Kellerman collaborated with the Ndlovu Youth Choir (a rural choir based in Moutse in the Limpopo province of South Africa) in 2018. Their African version of Ed Sheeran's Shape Of You became an internet sensation, going viral with tens of millions of views on social media, and winning awards like the HMMA (Hollywood Music in Media Awards) for ‘Best Independent Music Video’ - pushing the Ndlovu Youth Choir firmly into the international limelight. This resulted in America’s Got Talent scouting the choir to enter the 2019 competition. Ndlovu went ahead and delivered a sensational first few rounds, going all the way through to the finals of the competition, showcasing South African music and spirit in the process. Their collaboration is part of Kellerman’s 2019 album In A Different Light, in which he re-imagines and re-shapes some of his favourite melodies by approaching them from a fresh angle.","Johannesburg, South Africa",-26.2044,28.0456,1961.0

After leaving Davis in 1963, Kelly played with his own trio, which recorded for several labels and toured the United States and internationally. His career did not develop much further, and he had difficulty finding enough work late in his career.
